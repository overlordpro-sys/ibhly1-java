PriorityQueue<E> class will have:

private ArrayList<E> (yours from scratch)

Methods 
  void add(E item)
  boolean isEmpty()
  E peek()
  E remove()

  add will have a heapUp helper method
  remove will have a heapDown helper method


Remember that index 0 is null, so 
isEmpty and peek will be looking at/for
index 1

You'll have a menu that allows the user
to call add, isEmpty, peek, and remove. It 
will also have a loadFile method, which will
load file20.
